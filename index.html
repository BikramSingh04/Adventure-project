            <p>I see you have chosen to driving style. You will miss your first period and miss your english exam if you choose to drive calmly. If you drive recklessly you will be late for class but have 20 minutes to take your exam. This is your only time to change your driving style.</p>
            <p>If you choose to drive recklessly, double click on the gas pedal.</p>
            <p>If you choose to drive calmly, double click on the steering wheel.</p>
